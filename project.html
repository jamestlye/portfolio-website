                <p>
                The Eye-tTracking Goggles track a patient's glaze and map it onto the real world while measuring data for clinic diagnostic purposes. I worked on both the hardware and the software of the system as well as other complementary projects some are listed below. The goggles are built through 3D printed materials with some off-the-shelf electronics and customized camera components. It is able to track movement at a high frame rate with no visible light.
                <br></br>
                The goggles use the images of the eyes to calculate both in 2D and 3D where the pupils are and where they are looking. I highly recommend checking out the other videos and images for this one.

                <p>First Robotics is an organization that hosts robotics competition that allows teams to compete in games that revolve around objectives, where the game changes annually. I was the design lead of FRC1360 and we built robots from the ground up; brainstorming, designing, prototyping, CAD-ing and manufacturing. For designing, we use Solidworks for CAD and manufacturing using the blueprints drawings. Thanks to this experience I am a Certified Solidworks Professional (CSWP)

                <p>The Offical OYMS website was built by myself and four colleagues. The goal of the website was to promote OYMS and increase traffic. We were able to increase traffic by 150% by providing information on their mission, updates, events and podcasts. We were given this opportunity by OYMS and we built it from scratch under mentorship from OYMS. My responsibility was the podcast page, where users can view, watch, and listen to podcasts whenever a new episode is released. We built the site using responsive practices to ensure the content is properly displayed. 
                <br></br>
                The website is not hosted anymore so I included some screenshots from the previous version below.</p>

                <p>
                The Ball Catch Device is a complementary project for the Eye-racking goggles with the goal of incorporating active tests to analyze the hand-eye coordination performance of the patient based on the eyes and the hands.
                <br></br>
                The device is made with flexible 3D printed TPE "rings" that go on the finger to capture the gesture of the hand, which is interpreted by the Arduino and the output gets sent to the main test computer along with the eyes and other complementary test data.
